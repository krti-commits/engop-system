## What is this

A lightweight framework for engineering teams that want to stop building plausible things that aren't the customer thing.

The core idea: **make intent testable before you build**, so rework becomes the exception.

---

## The problem: avoidable churn

Teams build features where the interface or contract intent was ambiguous:

- Dashboard that exposed raw data, but users needed actionable insights
- Powerful API with 20 endpoints, but the UI only needed 3 operations
- Feature X implemented, but customer actually needed Feature Y

Not pervasive, but completely avoidable. The cost is engineering time spent building the right thing twice.

---

## The model: contract-first

> Contract-first = UX flow and API contract reviewed together before build starts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/flow-model.svg" alt="Intent → Design → Execution → Release" width="800"/>
</p>

Four layers. Nothing novel. The key constraint: UI must not drive API design in isolation. They're designed as a unit.

<p align="center">

</p>

If the mock or contract is missing, you build plausible outcomes that aren't the customer outcome. This chain prevents that.

### Templates

| Template | Purpose | When to use |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| [PRD-lite](templates/prd-lite.md) | One-page problem/solution/criteria | Before design starts |
| [Design note](templates/design-note.md) | Technical approach, API impacts, data model, security | Before coding starts |
| [UX mock](templates/ux-mock.md) | Screen layout + user journey + API surface | Before coding starts |

Each template includes a filled-in example so you can see what good looks like.

## How to get started

**If you're an engineer:** Copy a [template](templates/) for your next feature. Start with the [PRD-lite](templates/prd-lite.md) if requirements feel ambiguous, or the [design note](templates/design-note.md) if you're about to write code.

**If you're a tech lead:** Read the [case study](case-studies/applying-contract-first.md) to see contract-first applied end-to-end. Then review the [decision template](decisions/001-execution-operating-system.md) with your team.

**If you're building tooling:** The [ticket gatekeeping blueprint](automation/ticket-gatekeeping.md) is the highest-leverage automation target. It enforces this framework at the ticket system level.
